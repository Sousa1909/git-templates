# git-templates
#### Templates for Issues and Pull requests for github 

---

To use this all you have to do is have the two folders under `.github` in the `.github` folder in whatever project you are working on!

---

Feel free to make suggestions on how to improve the templates or if there are any different templates that could be added!
