# git-templates
#### Templates for Issues and Pull requests for GitHub 

---

To use this all you have to do is have the two folders under `Templates` in the `.github` folder in whatever project you are working on!  
**_NOTE:_** Do not change the name of the folders otherwise it won't work.

Feel free to make suggestions on how to improve the templates or if there are any different templates that could be added!
